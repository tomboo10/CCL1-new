## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **implementation of different objects:** It was easier than expected, to create many objects with different functions.
- **implementing the delay:** It also worked very well to implement the delay, that the surface only appears 10 seconds after the game has started.

### Challenges:
- **bomb detection feature:** Implementing this item/feature took me ages but i got it in the end (with help).
- **creating different levels:** It was pretty hard to create the different randomized maps according to the button, that has been pressed (easy, middle, advanced).

### Lessons Learned:
- **just start:** just start and not think too much in the beginning (once you have a rough plan).
- **not getting stressed at the start:** Don't worry too much at the start, when things don't go that smooth and easy.
